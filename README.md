# makefile

In order to generate a Makefile, a main.c, a .c and a .h you have to:

add the path to makefile.sh in your .bashrc:

```bash
<path>/makefile.sh
```

Then execute the following command:

```bash
./makefile.sh <argument1> <argument2>
```

The second argument is mandatory and has to be -h if you don't want to generate a .h file.
